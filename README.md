## Matrix Multiplication on CUDA

for this Parallel Processing lab I will be using the provided code to record
timing of a DNS matrix multiplication algorithm implemented using the CUDA
parallel processing toolkit.

 * For the first experiement (8x8) we will be using the provided code as-is and
record times.

* For the second portion of the experiement (16x16) the proogram was modified
  to use blocked matrix multiplication. See the
  [challenges](16x16/challenges.md) document for some notes onn problems I ran
  into while implementing the blocked matrix multiplication algorithm.
